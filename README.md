# MNIST-DIGIT-RECOGNIZER-USING-ConvNet-KERAS-Accuracy-0.9943-
The MNIST DIGIT RECOGNIZER  COMPETITION ON KAGGLE. The training dataset consists of 42000 rows each of 784 pixel values thus representing 28 x 28 sized 42000 images of different digits from 0 to 9 . I have trained Convolutional Neural Networks written in Keras to train the model and predicted on the 28000 images of the test dataset, Also achieved 99.43% accuracy on Kaggle with 20 epochs . Also used ImageDataGenerator to augment the training set and avoid overfitting problem .
